# Space Program Management UI

A Python UI program to manage a space program: rockets, requests and launches. It is built on top of the same [console program repository](https://github.com/kigris/Space_Program_Management) that I uploaded.

Documentation is included in the [console program repository](https://github.com/kigris/Space_Program_Management), go there and see "informe.pdf" file.

The UI is built using PyQt6. Screenshots are included in "screenshots" folder and a Windows build also in "build" folder.
